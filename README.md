# CoffePal

_Upbeat music starts_.

Have YOU ever forgotten a cup of coffee for to long when working on a project, resulting in a cold cup liquid of sadness? Then the _Coffee Pal_ is for YOU!

Jokes aside, event though I'm one of those sadistic people who enjoy cold coffee, this actually is a bit of a problem for me. It is even a bigger problem for my mum, who regulary walks away from her cups. The idea with the Coffee Pal is to have a little gadget that you can clip onto a cup. This will then sense when a cup has been stationary for to long, and then starts to make a noise to remind you to drink from it. This will continue periodicly until the cup has been moved, and hopefully drunk from. There is also a light sensor on there that will disable the notification if the room is to dark, to make sure it won't wake you up in the middle of the night if you've forgoten it. Everything on a little pcb that runs on a coin cell battery, and with a plastic clamp to fasten it to the cup.
